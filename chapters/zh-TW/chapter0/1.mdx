# Introduction

歡迎來到Hugging Face的教學！本篇介紹將會帶著你設置運行環境。如果你正開始學的話，不妨先看看[第一章](/course/chapter1)再回來，這樣就能直接開始試著跑裡面的程式碼了。

Welcome to the Hugging Face course! This introduction will guide you through setting up a working environment. If you're just starting the course, we recommend you first take a look at [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1), then come back and set up your environment so you can try the code yourself.

我們會用到的所有函式庫都將會以Python資源包的方式被取得，所以這邊我們會教你如何設置Python環境並安裝你所需要的函式庫。

All the libraries that we'll be using in this course are available as Python packages, so here we'll show you how to set up a Python environment and install the specific libraries you'll need.

本篇將會涵蓋兩種設置環境的方法 - 使用Colab notebook或是Python虛擬環境。選你自己覺得合適的方式就好，但是對於初學者我們強烈建議先從使用Colab notebook開始。

We'll cover two ways of setting up your working environment, using a Colab notebook or a Python virtual environment. Feel free to choose the one that resonates with you the most. For beginners, we strongly recommend that you get started by using a Colab notebook.

我們不會提到Windows系統，如果你是Windows的使用者，我們建議使用Colab notebook。如果你用的是Linux或是macOS，你可以任意選擇上述的兩種方法。

Note that we will not be covering the Windows system. If you're running on Windows, we recommend following along using a Colab notebook. If you're using a Linux distribution or macOS, you can use either approach described here.

大部分的教學都會需要一個Hugging Face的帳號。我們建議現在就[創一個](https://huggingface.co/join)。

Most of the course relies on you having a Hugging Face account. We recommend creating one now: [create an account](https://huggingface.co/join).

## 使用Google Colab notebook

用Colab notebook是最簡單容易的方法；在瀏覽器開一頁Colab notebook就能直接開始寫程式了！

Using a Colab notebook is the simplest possible setup; boot up a notebook in your browser and get straight to coding! 

如果你對Colab notebook不熟悉的話，我們建議你從這篇[介紹](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)開始。在Colab上你可以使用一些加速硬體，像是GPU或TPU，而且工作量不大的話也不收錢。

If you're not familiar with Colab, we recommend you start by following the [introduction](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Colab allows you to use some accelerating hardware, like GPUs or TPUs, and it is free for smaller workloads.

當你開始熟悉Colab後，建立新的筆記本然後開始進行設置：

Once you're comfortable moving around in Colab, create a new notebook and get started with the setup:

<div class="flex justify-center">

</div>

接下來就是安裝我們將會用到的函式庫。我們會使用 `pip` 這個Python的資源管理工具來安裝。在Colab notebook裡，你可以用 `!` 來執行系統指令，所以你可以用以下的指令來安裝 🤗 Transformers函式庫：

The next step is to install the libraries that we'll be using in this course. We'll use `pip` for the installation, which is the package manager for Python. In notebooks, you can run system commands by preceding them with the `!` character, so you can install the 🤗 Transformers library as follows:

```
!pip install transformers
```

把函式庫導入到Python runtime可以確認你的資源包有被正確地安裝：

You can make sure the package was correctly installed by importing it within your Python runtime:

```
import transformers
```

<div class="flex justify-center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-course/documentation-images/resolve/main/en/chapter0/install.gif" alt="A gif showing the result of the two commands above: installation and import" width="80%"/>
</div>

這會安裝一個非常輕量的🤗 Transformers。裡面沒有安裝任何像是PyTorch或TensorFlow等的機器學習框架。我們將會用到很多函式庫裡的不同功能，所以我們建議安裝包含了大部分使用情境所需要的資源的開發用版本：

This installs a very light version of 🤗 Transformers. In particular, no specific machine learning frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) are installed. Since we'll be using a lot of different features of the library, we recommend installing the development version, which comes with all the required dependencies for pretty much any imaginable use case:

```
!pip install transformers[sentencepiece]
```

這會花一點時間，不過裝完你就已經完全準備好面對剩下的教學了！

This will take a bit of time, but then you'll be ready to go for the rest of the course!

## 使用Python虛擬環境

如果你比較想用Python虛擬環境的話，第一步就是安裝Python。我們建議跟著[這篇教學](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)做為起手式。

If you prefer to use a Python virtual environment, the first step is to install Python on your system. We recommend following [this guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) to get started.

當你安裝好Python後，你應該就能從終端機下Python指令了。在進行下一步之前你可以先跑以下指令來確認Python有沒有安裝好：`python --version` 這條指令會讓終端機顯示你所安裝的Python版本。

Once you have Python installed, you should be able to run Python commands in your terminal. You can start by running the following command to ensure that it is correctly installed before proceeding to the next steps: `python --version`. This should print out the Python version now available on your system.

在終端機跑像是`python --version`的Python指令時，你應該把你所下的指令想成是用你系統上主要的Python版本來跑。我們建議不要在這個版本上安裝任何資源包，讓每個專案在各自獨立的環境裡運行就可以了。這樣每個專案都可以有各自的相依性跟資源包，你也不用擔心不同專案之間使用同一個環境時潛在的相容性問題。

When running a Python command in your terminal, such as `python --version`, you should think of the program running your command as the "main" Python on your system. We recommend keeping this main installation free of any packages, and using it to create separate environments for each application you work on — this way, each application can have its own dependencies and packages, and you won't need to worry about potential compatibility issues with other applications.

在Python我們可以用[*虛擬環境*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)來做這件事。

In Python this is done with [*virtual environments*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), which are self-contained directory trees that each contain a Python installation with a particular Python version alongside all the packages the application needs. Creating such a virtual environment can be done with a number of different tools, but we'll use the official Python package for that purpose, which is called [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv).

First, create the directory you'd like your application to live in — for example, you might want to make a new directory called *transformers-course* at the root of your home directory:

```
mkdir ~/transformers-course
cd ~/transformers-course
```

From inside this directory, create a virtual environment using the Python `venv` module:

```
python -m venv .env
```

You should now have a directory called *.env* in your otherwise empty folder:

```
ls -a
```

```out
.      ..    .env
```

You can jump in and out of your virtual environment with the `activate` and `deactivate` scripts:

```
# Activate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
source .env/bin/deactivate
```

You can make sure that the environment is activated by running the `which python` command: if it points to the virtual environment, then you have successfully activated it!

```
which python
```

```out
/home/<user>/transformers-course/.env/bin/python
```

### Installing dependencies

As in the previous section on using Google Colab instances, you'll now need to install the packages required to continue. Again, you can install the development version of 🤗 Transformers using the `pip` package manager:

```
pip install "transformers[sentencepiece]"
```

You're now all set up and ready to go!
